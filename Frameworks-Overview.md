# üìö**FRONT-END FRAMEWORKS OVERVIEW**
<br>

## üìå**WHAT** IS A FRAMEWORK?

- A framework is software that simplifies the development and maintenance of substantial projects. They also provide guidelines for creating the app architecture, which consists of a **skeletal framework** that must be modified and expanded according to its specifications.

- Examples of frameworks include utility applications, code libraries, and scripting languages. It makes it easier to design several parts of a software product. Instead of starting projects from scratch, developers may use frameworks as a base to add other project-specific functionality.

- With a **CSS framework**, the user has a completed CSS stylesheet, and they only have to code the HTML with accurate classes, structure, and IDs to set up a web page. The framework already includes classes built-in for common website elements ‚Äì footer, slider, navigation bar, hamburger menu, column-based layouts, etc.

- As a result, front-end frameworks are software product/tool/platform that serves as the foundation for the advancement of front-end components of web solutions.

To further explain what a framework is, here is an explanation:

A framework is a structure that you can build software on. It serves as a **foundation**, so you‚Äôre not starting entirely from scratch. Frameworks are typically associated with a [specific programming language](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=cw_what_is_a_framework_blog) and are suited to different types of tasks.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a house. You could pour the foundation and frame the house yourself. It would take a lot of time, but you could do it. If all of that were already done for you, though, it would save you quite a bit of effort, especially if it were done by expert home builders.

In software development, a framework serves a similar purpose. It‚Äôs designed and tested by other Software Developers and Engineers, so you know it‚Äôs a solid foundation.

A house isn‚Äôt complete with just the framework, though. Similarly, a framework in software development is a starting point, but you add higher-level functionality to it to make it work.

## üìå**FRAMEWORKS** VS. **LIBRARIES**

The terms **libraries** and **frameworks** are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are very different.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LimOOe6I4eo" target="_blank"> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTXMrhnkelk7jHISpolstnQl8e7I7IJMYa-xA&usqp=CAU" width="100%" height="auto"></a>

In the video above, Carlos, a Web Developer, explains that a library is a set of previously-written code that you can use to build your code. A framework is a supporting structure that requires specificity. You must follow the pattern of the framework.

A framework is essentially a skeleton, and you work with the skeleton. A framework calls on your code. Your code calls on a library. In other words, your code is in control when you use a library, but when you use a framework, it‚Äôs in control. This referred to as ‚Äúinversion of control.‚Äù

Frameworks can, and often do, including libraries. Libraries are used to fill out functions.

## üìå**WHY** USE A FRONT-END FRAMEWORK?

Using frameworks saves time and reduces the risk of errors. You do not need to write everything from the ground up, so there is less chance of introducing errors. Plus, frameworks have already been tested, so there is less to worry about. Other advantages include:

#### ‚úÖ**User-driven outcomes result from rapid development**
With the aid of the existing framework, the development of many site components maybe speed up. Similarly to that, it shortens the time needed for development.
<br>

#### ‚úÖ**Features and applications are more responsive**

Web designers may construct apps with quick-response capabilities thanks to the most recent front-end framework. These can be rapidly and easily modified, which enables the app to work and respond swiftly upon a tap.
<br>

#### ‚úÖ**Real-time programming is provided**

The people who gain the most from front-end website development are the developers. A web developer is capable of everything, including detecting any browser modifications and not worrying about the web application's location or the recurrence of loading the browser's pages.
<br>

#### ‚úÖ**Technology with numerous advantages**

One of the key advantages of a front-end web development framework is that it is supported by technology that is simple to scale, learn, and apply.
<br>

#### ‚úÖ**Secured**

Front-end web development code is relatively secure. This is one of the most important benefits at a time when hackers are trying to find a way to infiltrate your computer system.

## üìå**TYPES** OF FRONT-END FRAMEWORK?

Frameworks are used for developing websites, mobile applications, data science, and more. Here are the top 3 popular frameworks:

<br>

>### <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">**REACT**<img src="https://sf.ezoiccdn.com/ezoimgfmt/maheshwaghmare.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/reactjs-org-website-landing-page-1024x493.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<br>

<p>React, also known as ReactJS, is a well-known front-end JavaScript library for developing user interfaces and related components.</p>

<p>React, which is powered by Facebook, has been recognised as a fantastic library in the front-end family of tools. It uses the JSX coding style, with a mix of HTML quotes and tag syntax to create the components. It breaks down larger components into smaller ones that can be managed separately and individually.</p>

| Pros   | Cons |
| ------ | ---- |
| Component reusability facilitates collaboration and reuse in other parts of the application. | React dev tools are advanced and extremely useful. |
| Through the use of virtual DOM, you can achieve consistent and seamless performance. | Due to this frontend framework's multiple and constant updates, it is hard to create proper documentation, which has an effect on the learning curve for beginners. |
| It is the ultimate solution to writing components in React hooks because it allows you to write components without classes and makes learning React easier.  | When starting out with the framework, developers find it difficult to understand the complexities of JSX.  | 
| | It only provides solutions for the front end. |

<br>

>### <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">**ANGULAR**<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yKAI-9dD--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rvcfi5kygx01n0k71yzn.png" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<br>

<p>Angular is a component-based framework for developing scalable web applications, as well as a set of tools for developers to use to create, build, test, and modify code, and a collection of well-integrated libraries.</p>

<p>AngularJS was developed and is supported by Google. It includes features like two-way data binding, which reduces development time, and dependency injections, making it easier for different pieces of code to interact with each other.</p>

| Pros   | Cons |
| --- | ---- |
| There is built-in functionality to upgrade adjustments done in the model to the view and vice versa. | Because Angular is a complete dynamic solution, there are numerous ways to accomplish the work, and therefore learning curve is steeper. |
| Decreases the amount of code because most important features, such as two-way data binding, are provided by default. | Dynamic apps occasionally fail to perform well due to their complex structure and size. However, Angular code optimization and best practices. |
| By defining them as external elements, the components are decoupled from their dependencies.  | |
| Components are reusable and simple to manage when using dependency injection. |
A large learning and support community. | |

>### <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">**VUE.JS**<img src="https://appwrk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Vue.js-The-Progressive-JavaScript-Framework-1024x482.webp" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<br>

<p>Vue.js, as one of the best JavaScript libraries, has been creating interactive UI elements that are lightweight and easy to adapt. It provides data-reactive elements through a flexible and straightforward API. It is simple to complete smaller projects and then scale up to larger ones. </p>

| Pros   | Cons |
| ------ | ---- |
| Tiny and fast | Language barriers and a lack of plugins. |
| Friendly to beginners | It is relatively new and was created by private individuals.  |
| Detailed documentation  | A small developer community.  |
| Simple syntax  | Applicability to larger projects is limited.  |
| Two-way data binding  | It does not have a powerful business behind it.  |
| Has a positive effect on SEO  |  |
