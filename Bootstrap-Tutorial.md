### 📌**WHAT** IS BOOTSTRAP?
#

- **Bootstrap** is the most popular **CSS Framework** for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

- Bootstrap is a free and **open-source** CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

- Bootstrap is known for popularizing the focus on **responsive design** among web developers.

- With Bootstrap, developers don’t have to build separate projects around adjusting a site for smaller screen sizes. They just need to incorporate the necessary Bootstrap classes, and the design adjusts itself.

- Developed by **Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto** at Twitter as a framework to promote consistency across internal tools, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is an open-source framework containing CSS and JavaScript-based templates for interface components.

- As of December 2022, Bootstrap is the 14th most starred project (4th most starred library) on GitHub, with over 161,000 stars. According to W3Techs, Bootstrap is used by 19.2% of all websites.

### 📌**WHY** USE BOOTSTRAP?
#

#### ✅**Massive Ecosystem**

Among front-end frameworks, Bootstrap’s ecosystem is unmatched. It offers, out of the box, a vast library of layouts, themes, UI elements, panels, modals, buttons, alerts, cards, etc., that devs and designers can choose from and implement. Additionally, Bootstrap is backed by best-in-industry community support.
<br>

#### ✅**Accelerated Prototyping**

When using Bootstrap, designers can just write out their HTML code, include the relevant CSS classes, and achieve website responsiveness. They don’t have to spend time adjusting for browser incompatibility, CSS positioning, and the like.
<br>

#### ✅**Twitter Support**

Unsurprisingly, when a significant commercial player backs an open-source project, users can be assured that it is here to stay and carries high confidence among people who know the industry. The fact that Bootstrap grew out of, and is backed by Twitter, establishes its efficacy.
<br>

#### ✅**Supports SASS and LESS**

Although most developers don’t use LESS, significant projects rely on it. Obviously, SASS support is also highly desirable. Not too many CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap support both.

### 📌**FEATURES** OF BOOTSTRAP
#

- Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.

- Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery. They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs, and carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code.

- The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the width with the web page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of the screen showing the page:

        Smaller than 576 pixels
        576–768 pixels
        768–992 pixels
        992–1200 pixels
        Larger than 1200 pixels
